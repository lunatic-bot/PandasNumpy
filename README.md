# Data Processing with Pandas & NumPy

This repository contains my practice code, experiments, and mini-projects for learning and improving data processing skills using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.

The goal of this repo is to:

- Get hands-on with data wrangling, cleaning, and transformation.
- Practice common patterns for exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Build confidence in writing efficient NumPy and Pandas code.
- Create reusable snippets and reference material for future projects.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(Or directly install the essentials if requirements.txt is not provided:)

```bash
pip install pandas numpy jupyter
```

### Running Notebooks

Launch Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the `notebooks/` folder and open any file to start exploring.
